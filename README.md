# MedSAM2
This fork came from Bowang-lab MEDSAM2 [you can check it here](https://github.com/bowang-lab/MedSAM2). <br/>

## inference.py
The biggest feature introduced in this version is the script `inference.py`.
It allows to run the inference to find Clinical target tumor (CTV) in CT images using the fine tuned weights. <br/>
To have more information about the training process (how to run the script, dataset format, etc.) please check the original repo!
